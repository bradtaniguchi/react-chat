# Getting Started with Create React App

A client-side only application used to mess around with React using cra.

Purpose of this project is to get more familiar with React, rather than build anything cool.


## Description

This project is for a "chat-room", except since its front-end only, the only people you can talk with is **yourself**. 

There will be 3 pages:
- login - login/switch accounts
  - enter color the user will be displayed by
  - enter name the user will be displayed as within the app.
  - possible search
- chat-rooms - list of all the chat-rooms created
  - create a new room via a FAB
  - list of all the rooms
  - possible search
- chat-room - where all the "chatting" happens
  - list of all messages, similar to a "text" app.
  - entry-field to create a new message with a "send" button
  - will appear in the list of chats at the bottom.


There are multiple enhancements that could be made to this project, but this will be a good trial run with learning React + MUI.
